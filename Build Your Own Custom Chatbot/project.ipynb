Just bright enough to warrant a double take, yet subtle enough to be worked into daily wear, it's the type of deep blue that will excite even the most color-averse.

While sequins may feel over as soon as the clock strikes midnight on January 31, this year, designers are making a case for \"daytime shine\" – wearable separates that can spice up even the most basic staples like tank tops (see above) and blue jeans. While this trend comes in all metallic shades (gold, bronze, rose gold etc.), we are partial to the liquid silver look that can double as a neutral.\n",

Elevated basics is one such trend. Last season, there was a clear '90s directive when it came to minimalism, with logo vests, low-slung trousers and tube dresses being hero items. Now, things have been pared back even further; sure, Y2K maxi skirts and oversized suiting are very much a thing, as witnessed on the runways of Peter Do and Roksanda respectively, but the silhouettes are cleaner and the colour palette looks more expensive; think shades of teal, camel and navy.\n",

From a cellophane-like dress, worn over a boldly hued maxi skirt at Tory Burch's spring 2023 show, to a frothy frock revealing undergarments at Victoria Beckham, the previously risqué trend is coming not only for your weekend wardrobe but even workwear.\n",
